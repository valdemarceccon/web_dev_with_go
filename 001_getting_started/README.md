#### HANDS ON 1

create a type square
create a type circle
* attach a method to each that calculates area and returns it
* create a type shape which defines an interface as anything which has the area method
* create a func info which takes type shape and then prints the area
* create a value of type square
* create a value of type circle
* use func info to print the area of square
* use func info to print the area of circle

#### HANDS ON 2
* create a struct that holds person fields
* create a struct that holds secret agent fields and embeds person type
* attach a method to person: pSpeak
* attach a method to secret agent: saSpeak
* create a variable of type person
* create a variable of type secret agent
* print a field from person
* run pSpeak attached to the variable of type person
* print a field from secret agent
* run saSpeak attached to the variable of type secret agent
* run pSpeak attached to the variable of type secret agent

**SOLUTION**: https://play.golang.org/p/RxrkCJw9Cd 

#### HANDS ON 3
* create an interface type that both person and secretAgent implement
* declare a func with a parameter of the interfaceâ€™s type
* call that func in main and pass in a value of type person
* call that func in main and pass in a value of type secretAgent
